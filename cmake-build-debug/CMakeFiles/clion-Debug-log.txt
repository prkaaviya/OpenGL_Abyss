CMake Warning (dev) at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-3.29/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (GLEW) does
  not match the name of the calling package (glew).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/aarch64/share/cmake-3.29/Modules/Findglew.cmake:71 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package)
